# Movie_Recommender_App
A simple movie recommendation web application built using Flask, Scikit-Learn, and a content-based filtering approach. The app recommends similar movies based on user input by using cosine similarity and feature engineering on movie metadata. The frontend is designed with clean HTML/CSS, and the backend serves predictions through a lightweight API.
